## SUMMARY:
What did you clean up?: I cleaned up the polygon drawing by making it more efficient, as well as instantiating constants in global space.

Summary of function(s) added: Function to return turtles to starting position, function to make the turtles race, and function to make turtles draw a polygon.

Summary of Feature Added: Asks the user for integer input and has the two turtles draw their own polygon going in two different directions with inputted number of sides.

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS:
N/A

## REFERENCES:
N/A

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS:
I accidentally forgot the main in the initial commit but added it for the first commit. The readme and main got mixed up for the first two commits so that's why there's two different commits for those two first commits.
